The TethysDash landing page provides a summary of all available dashboards for the user. This includes dashboards that are 
owned by the user as well as all dashboards that are shared publicly.

Dashboard Cards
---------------

Each card in the landing page represents an available dashboard and provides information such as the name, description, owner status, public status, and 
a thumbnail. User dashboards are represented by the owner icon (|owner_icon|) in top left of the card. Public dashboards are represented by 
the public icon (|public_icon|) in top left of the card. Users can view the dashboard description by hovering over the card. The 3 dot menu on the 
top right of the card provides additional actions.

Creating a Dashboard
--------------------

.. |login_icon| image:: ../../images/login_icon.png
   :scale: 8%

In order to create a new dashboard, ensure that you are signed into the tethys portal. If a login icon (|login_icon|) is shown 
in the header of the app, click on it and sign in. 

If you are signed into the portal, then there will be a blank dashboard card with the text "Create a New Dashboard". Click on 
the "Create a New Dashboard" card, provide the name and description, and then click on the "Create" button.

Dashboard Card Context Menu
---------------------------
After cliking on the 3dots on the top right of a dashboard card, a context menu will appear with the following options:

   .. image:: ../../images/dashboard_context_menu.png
      :align: center

**Open**: Open and view the contents of the dashboard. Users can also double-click on the card to open the dashboard.

**Rename** (*Admin Privileges Required*): Rename the dashboard.

**Update Description** (*Editor Privileges Required*): Update the dashboard description.

**Update Thumbnail** (*Editor Privileges Required*): Update the dashboard thumbnail.

**Share → Make Public** (*Admin Privileges Required*): Share the dashboard so that it can be viewed by anyone. Other viewers will have read-only access.

**Share → Copy Public URL**: Copy the public URL to the clipboard.

**Share → Make Private** (*Admin Privileges Required*): Remove public access to the dashboard.

.. _share-update-permissions:
**Share → Update Permissions**   
(*Admin Privileges Required*): Manage what groups and people have different levels of access for the dashboard. When selected, a pop-up will appear allowing you to enter user names or group names to add them to the dashboard. You may assign each person as a viewer, editor, or admin.  
   - *Viewer*: Can see the dashboard on their landing page but cannot edit it.  
   - *Editor*: Can view the dashboard and edit its contents, description, and thumbnail.  
   - *Admin*: Can do everything an editor can, plus manage sharing permissions and rename the dashboard.  
Giving access to a group grants that level of access to all members in the group. The dashboard can also be made public.

**Copy** (*Sign In Required*): Create a copy of the dashboard for the user.

**Export**: Export the dashboard into a JSON file.

**Delete** (*Admin Privileges Required*): Delete the dashboard.

Importing Dashboards
--------------------

.. |dashboard_import_icon| image:: ../../images/dashboard_import.png
   :scale: 8%

In order to provide an easier way to share and update dashboards between tethysdash instances, dashboards can be imported 
using a structured JSON format. To import a dashboard, click on the dashboard import icon (|dashboard_import_icon|) in the 
header of the landing page. You will then be prompted to choose a json file and import the file. 

The structure of the JSON should be the following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "name": "dashboard name",
      "description": "dashboard description",
      "accessGroups": ["public"], // add "public" to the array to make it public or leave the array empty to make it private
      "unrestrictedPlacement": false, // determines if dashboard items can overlap and be placed anywhere
      "notes": "dashboard notes", // notes that can be viewed with the dashboard
      "gridItems": [ // each object within the array represents and individual item within the dashboard
         {
            "i": 1, // a unique integer id for the item
            "x": 0, // x coordinate of the top left corner
            "y": 0, // y coordinate of the top left corner
            "w": 33, // width (based on the grid size) of the item
            "h": 44, // height (based on the grid size) of the item
            "source": "cnrfc_10day_daily_maximum_streamflow_probability", // this refers to the intake driver name used for the visualization. This is just an example
            "args_string": { // any necessary arguments for the intake driver. This is just an example
               "gauge_location": "CREC1"
            },
            "metadata_string": { // any custom settings for the item. This is just an example. See below for possible options
               "border": {
                  "border": "1px solid black"
               },
               "customMessaging": {
                  "error": "A custom error"
               }
            }
         }
      ]
   }


The following options are available for the metadata_string key:
   
   * **border** (object)
      * **border**: Determines the style for all borders. Value follows the CSS pattern for defining a border e.g. "1px solid black".
      * **border-bottom**: Determines the style for the bottom border. Value follows the CSS pattern for defining a border e.g. "1px solid black".
      * **border-top**: Determines the style for the top border. Value follows the CSS pattern for defining a border e.g. "1px solid black".
      * **border-left**: Determines the style for the left border. Value follows the CSS pattern for defining a border e.g. "1px solid black".
      * **border-right**: Determines the style for the right border. Value follows the CSS pattern for defining a border e.g. "1px solid black".
   
   * **boxShadow** (string): Determines the style for the box shadow around the item. Value follows the CSS pattern for defining a box shadow e.g. "4px 0 8px black".
   
   * **backgroundColor** (string): Determines the style for the background color of the item. Value follows the CSS pattern for defining colors (simple name, hex, etc)
   
   * **customMessaging** (object)
      * **error**: A custom error to show when the visualization processing has an error.
      * **<Variable Input Name>**: A custom message to show when the provided Variable Input has no value.
   
   * **refreshRate** (integer): Determines the time interval for which the visualization will be refreshed to get newest information
  
   * Any additional settings for specific visualizations (see :ref:`settings_tab`)

Manage Visualization Permissions
----------------------------

When creating plugins (detailed more :ref:`here <visualizationplugins>`), one option in the plugin is the parameter ``visualization_permissions``. It defaults to ``false``; however, if set to ``true`` then permissions can be updated for that specific visualization. A group name or username can be added to a specific visualization. Only users with permission will be able to access those visualizations.

If none of the plugins include this option, then visualization permissions cannot be adjusted on the landing page.


Manage Groups
-------------

Manage Groups allows you to create groups of users so that access can be granted to an entire group without selecting individual users each time. To manage groups, select the icon for groups in the upper right-hand corner. This opens a pop-up window that allows you to edit or delete existing groups and to create new ones.

To create a new group, click **Create New Group**. Then enter a name and a description for the group. Add users using their username. Users may be either *members* or *admins* of the group. Group admins can make edits to the group.
