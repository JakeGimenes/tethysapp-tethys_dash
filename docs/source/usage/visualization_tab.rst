Visualization Arguments
```````````````````````
Once a visualization type is selected, more options/arguments may appear  that are visualization specific. These 
additional arguments are used to select specific values needed for the visualizations. 

For example, if an option is selected for a chart that shows a hydrologic forecast, the visualization also needs to 
know which location to check. In this example, a new option may appear so that the user can choose which location to 
view.
