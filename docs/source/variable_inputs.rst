Variable Inputs
===============

Variable inputs are a way to make dashboards more dynamic. Instead of making multiple dashboards to view the same 
visualizations with slightly different arguments, users can use variable inputs to dynamically change visualizations 
within the dashboards.

In the example below, a user can use variable inputs to simplify data analysis for multiple sites. Instead of creating 
3 unique dashboards to view similar data for 3 different gauge locations, a user can make a single dashboard with 
visualizations that are tied to a variable input dropdown. When the user updates the variable input dropdown, the 
connected visualizations will automatically recognize the change and update accordingly.

Set Up
------

To setup a variable input, perform the following:

    1. Edit the visualization of a dashboard item. See :ref:`edit_dashboard_items` for more information if needed.
    2. For the "Visualization Type" option, select "Variable Input".
    3. For the "Variable Name" option, set the label/name of the variable.
    4. For the "Variable Options Source" option, users can select from a several options:

        - **text:** This will create a text based HTML input with a visualization refresh button. 
        - **number:** This will create a number based HTML input with a visualization refresh button.
        - **checkbox:** This will create a checkbox HTML input.
        - **date:** This will create a date picker HTML input with a visualization refresh button. Enter a default value by selecting on the calendar.
        - **date-hour:** Same as above, but there will also be an option to select he time.
        - **slider:** This will create a slider HTML input. You will have the option to choose between "Single Value" or "Range". Then you can choose the data type to either be a "number" or "date". You will then select the minimum and maximum values for the slider along with the step side. For "Single Value" you will choose an initial value. For "Range" you will choose an range start and range end value. In both cases you will get to choose the output format.
        - **csv uploader:** This will create a file uploader HTML input that only accepts CSV files. You can choose the CSV columns by entering a value in "CSV Columns" and hitting enter.
        - **EXISTING VISUALIZATION INPUTS:** The options under this item are derived from arguments for installed visualization plugins. Selecting one of these options will imitate the visualization argument but make it a variable input.

Connecting to Visualizations
----------------------------

After a variable input has been created, users must connect visualizations to the variable inputs in order to use them. 
To connect variable inputs, perform the following:

    1. Edit the visualization of a dashboard item. See :ref:`edit_dashboard_items` for more information if needed.
    2. For the visualization argument that will use the variable input, connect it to the variable input by doing the following:

        - If the argument is a **dropdown**, scroll to the bottom of the list and there is a section of "Variable Inputs". Select the desired variable input.

        - If the argument is a **text** input, set the value to be "**${Variable Input Name}**"
