Attributes/Popup Tab
--------------------

The Attributes/Popup tab is used to configure the interaction with the layer in the map once it is clicked.
**After the layer name and required source properties are configured**, then a table of layers and their attributes 
will be shown.

A checkbox at the top of the tab says "Allow Layer Query", which enables click interaction for the layer. If the checkbox is unchecked, no table of attrbute will load because the layer will not be queriable.

Within this table, fields can be configured to handle click interaction in 2 ways:

    1- When a layer is clicked, a popup will be shown with the attributes for that selected feature(s). Attributes can be 
    configured to not be shown in popups by unchecking the "Show in popup" column.

    2- Fields can be configured to work with and update variable inputs. See the :ref:`variableinputs` section for more 
    information on how variable inputs work. In the "Variable Input Name" column of the table, add a desired variable input 
    for the field whose value will be used for the variable input when a feature is clicked. 


.. note::
    A variable input can be configured within the attributes table and not need its own variable input 
    visualization in the dashboard. For example, a chart can be configured to reference a new variable input.
    Then within the map, a field can use that new variable input for updating. Once a map feature is clicked, the 
    chart will automatically be updated with the configured field of the clicked layer, without the need to change 
    a dropdown or text input within the dashboard itself. An example of this is shown below.

    .. video:: ../videos/map_variable_input.mp4
        :autoplay:
        :loop:
        :class: variable-input-video

|

If the layer loads correctly, then a static table will be shown with the available attributes.

    :align: center

If the layer loads incorrectly, then a dynamic table will be shown, in which the fields can be custom added. New rows 
can be created with tabbing through the inputs.

.. figure:: ../../images/attribute_unsuccessful.png
    :align: center

If the layer loads correctly but not attributes are found, then no table will be shown and a warning will appear, 
indicating that no attributes were found.
